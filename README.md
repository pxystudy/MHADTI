# MHADTI
MHADTI: The codes demo for paper "MHADTI:Predicting drug-target interactions via multiview heterogeneous information network embedding with hierarchical attention mechanisms".

# About Data
* heterogeneous: three heterogeneous graph obtained by constructing and fusing similarity networks
* heterogeneous/DTD.txt: the adjacency matrix based on meta-path drug-target-drug
* drug.txt: list of drug names
* target.txt: list of target names
* drug_feature.txt: initial feature of the corresponding drug name
* target_feature.txt: initial feature of the corresponding target name
* DT_interaction.txt: all the drug-target interactions
* Anyone can download this datasets and preprocess it as described in the paper. If there is any more question about dataset, please feel free to contact one of authors Peng Xiangyu.

# Quick start
Just run the code "main.py" directly.

# Thanks!
